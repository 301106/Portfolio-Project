I created this portfolio using basic *HTML* and *CSS*.  
First, I designed the main page (index.html) with sections like About, Projects, and Contact. Then I added a navigation bar to move between sections easily.
I made a separate page (skills.html) just to show my skills, and styled both pages using two CSS files.
This project helped me practice webpage structure, styling, and linking multiple pages together.
